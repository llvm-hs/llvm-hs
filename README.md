# llvm-hs - Haskell bindings for LLVM

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/llvm-hs/llvm-hs.svg?branch=llvm-6)](https://travis-ci.org/llvm-hs/llvm-hs) [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/llvm-hs.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/llvm-hs)

This project aims to provide a relatively complete set of bindings for
the LLVM API. If you find that anything is missing please open an
issue! We generally try to stay close to the LLVM C++-API so you can
consult the LLVM documentation and reuse existing resources.

## Getting started

If youâ€™ve worked with LLVM before, take a look at the examples in the
[llvm-hs-examples repo](https://github.com/llvm-hs/llvm-hs-examples).
If not, you can find a translation of the [official LLVM
tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/#kaleidoscope-implementing-a-language-with-llvm)
at https://github.com/llvm-hs/llvm-hs-kaleidoscope. There is also a
[blog series](https://blog.josephmorag.com/tags/llvm/) on writing a C
compiler with the library. In general, we try to stay very close to
the API and AST provided by LLVM itself, so the [LLVM language
reference](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html) is also very useful.

## Contributing

We love all kinds of contributions so feel free to open issues for
missing LLVM features, report & fix bugs or report API
inconveniences.

## Installing LLVM

LLVM 12 is still not fully released, and as such is unavailable in most
package managers. For now, the only reliable way to obtain the binaries
is to build it form source, following the instructions below.

### Building from source

Example of building LLVM from source. Detailed build instructions are available
on the LLVM.org website [here](http://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html). [CMake
3.4.3](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html) and a recent C++
compiler are required, at least Clang 3.1, GCC 4.8, or Visual Studio 2015
(Update 3).

  1. Download and unpack the [LLVM source code](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project):
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project -b release/12.x --single-branch
     cd llvm-project
     ```

  2. Create a temporary build directory and `cd` to it, for example:
     ```sh
     mkdir build && cd build
     ```

  3. Execute the following to configure the build. Here, `INSTALL_PREFIX` is
     where LLVM is to be installed, for example `/usr/local`:
     ```sh
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALL_PREFIX -DLLVM_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS=1 -DLLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB=True -DLLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB=True ../llvm
     ```
     See [options and variables](http://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html#options-and-variables)
     for a list of additional build parameters you can specify (we especially recommend the
     `ninja` build system).

  4. Build and install:
     ```sh
     cmake --build .
     cmake --build . --target install
     ```


## Versioning

Trying to represent the version of LLVM in the version number but also
allowing for version bumps in the bindings themselves while respecting
the [PVP](http://pvp.haskell.org/) can be tricky. Luckily LLVM is
switching to a
[new versioning scheme](http://blog.llvm.org/2016/12/llvms-new-versioning-scheme.html)
of `major.0.patch` starting from version `4.0`. This means that we can
use the last two components for these bindings while the first
component indicates the version of LLVM. A special case are the
versions `3.major.minor` that represent bindings to LLVM 3.9. Bindings
to earlier versions are not provided.

## How is this related to llvm-general?

This project is a fork of the venerable `llvm-general` that aims to improve the public release story, and better provide the interfaces needed for any Haskell project looking to leverage LLVM. Contributions are encouraged.

## IRBuilder

A IRBuilder, starting out as a thin reinterpretation of the C++ IRBuilder inside
of a Haskell State monad. Goal is to eliminate a lot of boilerplate around the
most common uses of `llvm-hs` as a compiler backend.

Example LLVM module that adds two numbers:

```llvm
; ModuleID = 'exampleModule'

define external ccc i32 @add(i32 %a, i32 %b){
entry:
  %0 = add i32 %a, %b
  ret i32 %0
}
```

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# LANGUAGE RecursiveDo #-}

import Data.Text.Lazy.IO as T

import LLVM.Pretty  -- from the llvm-hs-pretty package
import LLVM.AST hiding (function)
import LLVM.AST.Type as AST
import qualified LLVM.AST.Float as F
import qualified LLVM.AST.Constant as C

import LLVM.IRBuilder.Module
import LLVM.IRBuilder.Monad
import LLVM.IRBuilder.Instruction

simple :: IO ()
simple = T.putStrLn $ ppllvm $ buildModule "exampleModule" $ mdo

  function "add" [(i32, "a"), (i32, "b")] i32 $ \[a, b] -> mdo

    entry <- block `named` "entry"; do
      c <- add a b
      ret c
```
